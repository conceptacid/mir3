# MIR3
## Music Instrument Recognition using convolutional neural networks

The repository contains the source code for music instrument recognition implemented in python/tensorflow v0.12.
The model was trained using the MedleyDB dataset

## Prediction
- After cloning the repository, run sh_download_model_1.sh
- Then run predict.py <path-to-wave-file>

## Training
- Step 1. run *data_chop_medley_db.py* to chop long tracks into normalized 3-seconds chunks, excluding silence
- Step 2. run *data_prepare_mini_experiment.py* to prepare data subsets to be used for training and validation
- Step 3. run *data_prepare_spectrograms.py* to do resampling, FFT and MFCC 
- Step 4. run *train.py* for training

## Experiments
run MFCC.ipynb and MedleyExamples.ipynb
